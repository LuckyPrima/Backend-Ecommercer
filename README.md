# Backend E-commerce Application

This repository contains the backend code for an e-commerce application. It is responsible for handling business logic, data management, and providing APIs for the [frontend application](https://github.com/LuckyPrima/Frontend-Ecommerce).

## üöÄ Overview

This backend is built to support the core functionalities of an e-commerce platform, including product management, user authentication, order processing, and more. It is designed to be a robust and scalable **RESTful API**.

- **User Management:** User registration, login, and authentication (e.g., JWT).
- **Product Management:** CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for products, categories, and inventory.
- **Order Management:** Order creation, order status, and order history.
- **RESTful API:** Provides structured endpoints for interaction with the frontend application.
- **Database Handling:** Interaction with the database to store and retrieve data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project is built using the following key technologies:

- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language (100% of the codebase).
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js:** Web framework for Node.js, used for building RESTful APIs.
- **Sequelize:** ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for database interaction (indicated by `.sequelizerc`).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL.
- **PM2:** (Indicated by `ecosystem.config.js`) A production process manager for Node.js applications.
